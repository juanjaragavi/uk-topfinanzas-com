# Cookie Policy

**Effective Date:** 06 April 2025
**Last Updated:** 06 April 2025

This Cookie Policy explains how **Top Networks Inc.** ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies on our website [uk.topfinanzas.com](https://uk.topfinanzas.com) (the "Site"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

This policy should be read together with our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy), which explains how we use personal information.

## 1. What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, **Top Networks Inc.**) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

## 2. Why Do We Use Cookies?

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Site to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. Third parties serve cookies through our Site for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

## 3. Types of Cookies We Use

The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our Site and the purposes they perform are described below:

-   **Strictly Necessary Cookies:** These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Site to you, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our Site functions.
-   **Performance and Functionality Cookies:** These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Site but are non-essential to its use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality (like remembering your preferences) may become unavailable.
-   **Analytics and Customisation Cookies:** These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Site is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customise our Site for you. We primarily use Google Analytics for this purpose.
-   **Advertising Cookies:** These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. We use Google AdSense, which employs cookies (like the DART cookie) to serve ads based on your visit to our Site and other sites on the Internet.

## 4. How Can You Control Cookies?

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.

-   **Browser Controls:** You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Site though your access to some functionality and areas may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.
-   **Opting Out of Targeted Advertising:** Many advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or [http://www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com). You can opt out of Google's use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad Preferences page: [http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/).
-   **Cookie Consent Tool:** Upon your first visit to our Site, you may be presented with a cookie banner requesting your consent for non-essential cookies. You can manage your preferences through this tool at any time (if implemented).

## 5. Third-Party Cookies

As mentioned, third parties like Google Analytics and Google AdSense may set cookies when you visit our Site. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements.
