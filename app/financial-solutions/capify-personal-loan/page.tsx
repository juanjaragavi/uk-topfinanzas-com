                  Capify is a global fintech lender specializing in providing
                  accessible and flexible finance solutions to small and
                  medium-sized businesses. In the UK, they are particularly
                  known for their Merchant Cash Advance (MCA) product alongside
                  more traditional business loans, catering to SMEs that may
                  find conventional bank lending challenging.

                  Merchant Cash Advance (MCA): Funding Based on Sales
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  Capify's MCA is an innovative funding solution ideal for
                  businesses that accept card payments (e.g., retail,
                  restaurants, hospitality). Instead of a fixed loan amount,
                  Capify provides an upfront cash sum in exchange for a
                  percentage of the business's future daily card sales.
                  Repayments are automatically deducted as a small percentage of
                  each card transaction until the agreed amount is repaid. This
                  means repayments flex with the business's revenue – higher
                  sales lead to faster repayment, while slower periods mean
                  lower repayments, easing cash flow pressure.

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  Alongside MCAs, Capify offers fixed-term business loans,
                  typically ranging from £5,000 to £500,000. These function more
                  like traditional loans with set repayment schedules (often
                  daily or weekly fixed payments) over terms usually ranging
                  from 6 to 18 months. These loans are suitable for specific
                  investments, expansion projects, or bridging larger financial
                  gaps where a fixed repayment structure is preferred.

                  Capify prioritizes a fast and simple application process.
                  Businesses can apply online quickly, and decisions are often
                  made within 24-48 hours. They focus on the business's recent
                  performance and potential rather than solely relying on
                  historical credit scores, which can make funding more
                  accessible for businesses with less traditional profiles or
                  those recovering from past challenges.
