                  One of the key attractions of a Revolut Personal Loan is the
                  speed and ease of the application process. Existing Revolut
                  customers can often apply directly within the app in just a
                  few minutes, leveraging their existing verified profile.
                  Decisions are typically fast, sometimes instant or within the
                  same day, reflecting Revolut's use of advanced data analytics
                  and automated processes. Funding is also quick upon approval,
                  often appearing in the Revolut account shortly after
                  acceptance.

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  Revolut offers loan amounts typically ranging from £1,000 to
                  £25,000, suitable for various purposes like debt
                  consolidation, funding education, purchasing vehicles, or
                  covering unexpected expenses. Repayment terms are flexible,
                  usually spanning from 1 to 5 years, allowing borrowers to

                  Revolut's approach to personal loans differs from traditional
                  banks by heavily relying on technology, data analytics, and a
                  digital-first user experience. This often results in faster
                  processes but may involve less human interaction compared to
                  high-street banks. Eligibility and rates can be influenced by
                  your activity and history within the Revolut app itself.
