                      If you use your credit card to withdraw cash from an ATM
                      or to purchase foreign currency, you'll typically be
                      charged a cash advance fee (usually a percentage of the
                      amount withdrawn with a minimum charge) plus interest from
                      the day of the transaction. It's generally advisable to
                      avoid using credit cards for cash withdrawals due to these
                      higher costs.

                      importantly, missed payments can negatively impact your

                      Your initial credit limit will depend on your
                      creditworthiness and affordability assessment. M&S Bank
                      aims to provide credit limits that are appropriate for
                      your financial circumstances. If you use your card
                      responsibly and make payments on time, you may be eligible
                      for credit limit increases in the future.

                      Submitting a full application will result in a hard credit
                      search, which will be visible on your credit file and may
                      have a small, temporary impact on your credit score.
                      However, if you use an eligibility checker first (if
                      available), this only conducts a soft search that doesn't
                      affect your credit score. Using your card responsibly once
                      approved can help improve your credit score over time.

                      M&S Bank considers each application individually, taking
                      into account your overall financial circumstances. Whilst
                      having a good credit history improves your chances of
                      approval, M&S Bank may still consider applications from
                      individuals with varied credit profiles. If you're
                      uncertain about your eligibility, consider using an
                      eligibility checker or working on improving your credit
                      score before applying.

                      The online application form typically takes 5-10 minutes
                      to complete, and many applicants receive an instant
                      decision. If M&S Bank needs additional time to review your
                      application, you'll usually hear back within a few working
                      days. Once approved, your card typically arrives within
                      7-10 working days.

                    Credit is subject to status and affordability. The
                    representative APR is 23.9% (variable). You must be a UK
                    resident aged 18 or over. Credit cards should be used
                    responsibly. You should only borrow what you can afford to
                    repay, and ideally pay off your full balance each month to
                    avoid interest charges. Missing payments can negatively
                    impact your credit score and result in additional fees. This
