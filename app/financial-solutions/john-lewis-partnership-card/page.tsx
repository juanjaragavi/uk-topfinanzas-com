                  your loyalty whilst providing flexible credit facilities for
                  managing your shopping expenses. Whether you're updating your

                  New cardholders benefit from an attractive welcome offer that
                  accelerates your points earning from day one. For the first 60
                  days after opening your account, you'll earn double points on
                  eligible purchases at John Lewis and Waitrose—equivalent to 10
                  points for every £4 spent. This introductory bonus allows you
                  to quickly accumulate points towards your first gift voucher,
                  making it an ideal time to plan larger purchases or stock up
                  on essentials at Waitrose.

                <p className="text-left text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  After the initial double points period, the card continues to
                  reward your spending with a generous standard earn rate.
                  You'll collect 5 points for every £4 spent on eligible
                  purchases at John Lewis and Waitrose, ensuring your regular
                  shopping trips consistently contribute to your rewards
                  balance. Additionally, the card earns 1 point for every £10
                  spent elsewhere, meaning you can accumulate points even when
                  shopping at other retailers, paying bills, or making everyday
                  purchases outside the Partnership stores.

                  One of the most convenient features of the John Lewis
                  Partnership Card is the automatic conversion of points into
                  gift vouchers. Every 500 points you earn is automatically
                  converted into a £5 gift voucher, which is sent to you up to
                  three times per year. These vouchers can be spent on anything
                  you like at John Lewis and Waitrose, from groceries and
                  fashion to electronics and homeware. There's no need to
                  remember to claim your rewards or navigate complex redemption
                  processes—your vouchers arrive automatically, ready to use.

                  promotions designed to boost your points balance. These
                  additional benefits add significant value to the card, making
                  it more than just a standard rewards credit card.
