                  The Starling Bank Credit Card is a natural extension of the
                  award-winning digital bank's approach to financial services.
                  As one of the UK's most respected neobanks, Starling has built
                  its reputation on challenging traditional banking models with
                  transparent, customer-focused alternatives. The Starling
                  Credit Card carries forward this mission, offering a credit
                  product that aligns with modern banking expectations while
                  maintaining ethical principles.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">
                  Ethical Approach to Credit
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  At the foundation of the Starling Credit Card is an ethical
                  approach to lending. Unlike some traditional credit cards that
                  profit from customer debt, Starling emphasizes responsible
                  borrowing through transparent terms, fair rates, and tools
                  that help customers manage their credit effectively. The card
                  lacks the complex fee structures often found in traditional
                  products, with no hidden charges or penalties designed to trap
                  customers in debt cycles. This ethical foundation aligns with
                  Starling's broader mission of building a bank that works in
                  the best interest of its customers, not against them.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">
                  Digital-First Experience
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  True to its neobank roots, Starling delivers a fully digital
                  credit card experience. From application to everyday use, the
                  entire process is managed through Starling's award-winning
                  app. Transactions appear instantly with clear merchant
                  information and automatic categorization, while real-time
                  spending notifications help you stay on top of your finances.
                  The app provides detailed insights into your spending
                  patterns, making it easier to understand where your money goes
                  and identify areas for potential savings. These digital tools
                  transform the credit card from a simple payment method into a
                  comprehensive financial management solution.

                  Seamless Banking Integration
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  For existing Starling customers, the credit card integrates
                  seamlessly with the bank's other products. The card appears
                  alongside your current account in the same app, creating a
                  unified view of your finances. This integration extends to
                  features like instant payments from your Starling current
                  account to your credit card, spending analysis that combines
                  transactions across all your Starling products, and a
                  consistent user experience throughout. This cohesive approach
                  reduces the fragmentation typically associated with managing
                  multiple financial products.

                  reflects the bank's broader commitment to responsible banking
                  practices. Starling is a certified B Corporation, meaning it

                  performance, accountability, and transparency. By choosing a
                  Starling Credit Card, customers support a business model that
                  considers its impact on employees, customers, communities, and
