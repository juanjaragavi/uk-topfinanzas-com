                  The Marbles Credit Card stands out in the UK credit card
                  market by focusing on helping customers stay in control of
                  their finances. Whether you're building your credit history,
                  recovering from past financial difficulties, or simply seeking
                  a straightforward credit card with manageable limits, Marbles
                  offers a combination of innovative technology and practical
                  features designed to support your financial wellbeing.

                  FastCheck: Know Before You Apply
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  One of Marbles' most valuable features is the FastCheck
                  eligibility checker, which allows you to see your chances of
                  acceptance before submitting a full application. This soft
                  search technology provides an instant response without
                  affecting your credit rating—a crucial advantage when you're
                  exploring your credit options. Traditional credit card
                  applications involve hard credit checks that can temporarily
                  lower your credit score, but Marbles' FastCheck system lets
                  you assess your eligibility risk-free. This means you can make
                  more informed decisions about whether to proceed with a full
                  application, helping you avoid unnecessary credit inquiries
                  that could impact your credit file.

                  Manageable Credit Limits for Financial Control
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  Marbles takes a responsible approach to credit by offering
                  manageable credit limits starting from £250 up to £1,500. This
                  range is specifically designed to help you maintain control
                  over your spending whilst still providing useful credit access
                  for everyday purchases, emergencies, or building your credit
                  history. Unlike cards with high credit limits that can tempt
                  overspending, Marbles' approach encourages financial
                  discipline and responsible credit use. Additionally, your
                  credit limit can be reviewed after three months, meaning you
                  could receive an increase on your fourth statement if you've
                  demonstrated responsible usage—rewarding good financial
                  behaviour whilst still maintaining sensible limits.

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  Marbles provides extensive tools to help you stay on top of
                  your account and avoid common credit card pitfalls. The online
                  account management system allows you to view transactions,
                  track your balance, and manage payments whenever and wherever
                  you want. You'll receive text alerts when you're approaching
                  your credit limit, helping you avoid declined transactions and
                  potential over-limit fees. The ability to choose your monthly
                  repayment date adds flexibility, allowing you to align
                  payments with your salary or other income to make budgeting
                  easier. You can even change your payment date up to twice a
                  year if your financial circumstances change, demonstrating
                  Marbles' commitment to adapting to your life rather than
                  forcing you into rigid structures.

                  (variable). This means that at least 51% of successful
                  applicants will receive this rate, though the actual APR
                  you're offered will depend on your individual circumstances

                  If you borrow £1,200 at a representative APR of 34.9%
                  (variable), and you make the minimum payment each month,
                  you'll pay interest charges. To minimise interest costs, aim
                  to pay more than the minimum payment whenever possible or pay
                  your balance in full each month.

                  The Marbles Credit Card is particularly well-suited for
                  individuals who want to maintain strict control over their
                  credit usage or who are working to build or rebuild their
                  credit history. The manageable credit limits prevent
                  overspending whilst still providing useful credit access, and
                  the comprehensive management tools help you stay on top of
                  your account. If you've had credit difficulties in the past,
                  are new to credit, or simply prefer a card with lower limits
                  and strong control features, Marbles offers a practical
                  solution designed with your financial wellbeing in mind.

                  damage to your credit score. Combined with the no annual fee
