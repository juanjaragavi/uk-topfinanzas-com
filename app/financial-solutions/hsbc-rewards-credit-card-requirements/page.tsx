                    No, you don't need to be an existing HSBC customer to apply
                    for the HSBC Rewards Credit Card. The card is available to
                    any eligible UK resident who meets the qualification
                    criteria, regardless of whether they currently bank with
                    HSBC.

                    rate?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-base text-gray-700">
                    You must complete balance transfers within 60 days of your
                    account opening to qualify for the 0% interest rate for 6
                    months. After the promotional period ends, the standard
                    purchase rate of 26.9% APR (variable) will apply to any
                    remaining balance.

                    How do I redeem my reward points?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-base text-gray-700">
                    You can redeem your reward points through the Mastercard Pay
                    with Rewards app, which allows you to offset eligible
                    purchases made with your HSBC Rewards Credit Card. The app
                    is available for download on iOS and Android devices. Simply
                    select the purchases you want to redeem points against, and
                    the corresponding points will be deducted from your rewards
                    balance.

                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-base text-gray-700">
                    Yes, applying for the HSBC Rewards Credit Card will result
                    in a hard credit check, which will be recorded on your
                    credit file and may temporarily affect your credit score.
                    Multiple credit applications in a short period can have a
                    cumulative negative effect, so it's advisable to space out
                    applications and only apply when you're confident you meet
                    the eligibility criteria.

                    Can I increase my credit limit after approval?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-base text-gray-700">
                    Yes, you may be able to request a credit limit increase
                    after you've held the card for several months and
                    demonstrated responsible use. HSBC will reassess your
                    financial circumstances and creditworthiness before
                    approving any increase. You can request a credit limit
                    increase through online banking or by contacting HSBC
                    customer service.

                    Missing a payment or paying less than the minimum amount due
                    can result in late payment fees, additional interest
                    charges, and potential damage to your credit score. HSBC may
                    also withdraw any promotional interest rates. To avoid
                    missing payments, set up a Direct Debit to ensure at least
                    the minimum payment is made automatically each month.
