                Why Choose the Ocean Credit Card?
              </h2>

              <p className="text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 mb-6 text-left">
                Ocean Finance has been helping UK consumers access credit since
                1991, with over 1.1 million people pre-approved for financial
                products. The Ocean Credit Card, powered by Capital One, is
                specifically designed for people who may have been declined
                elsewhere or who want to rebuild their credit history. Unlike
                many credit-building cards, Ocean considers all credit
                histories, making it an accessible option for a wide range of
                applicants.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 mb-6 text-left">
                What sets the Ocean Credit Card apart is the innovative
                QuickCheck system. This soft search technology allows you to
                check whether you'll be accepted before you formally apply,
                giving you confidence and avoiding unnecessary hard searches on
                your credit file. Within just 60 seconds, you'll know if you're
                likely to be approved, and this check is completely invisible to
                other lenders—it won't affect your credit score at all.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 mb-6 text-left">
                The card also comes with modern conveniences you'd expect from
                any credit card provider. You can manage your account through
                the Ocean mobile app, making payments and checking your balance
                on the go. The card is contactless enabled, allowing you to make
                quick payments up to £100 without entering your PIN. Plus,
                you'll receive free email and text alerts to help you keep track
                of your spending and avoid missing payments.

              <p className="text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 mb-6 text-left">
                The Ocean Credit Card has a representative APR of 39.9%
                (variable), with a purchase rate of 39.94% APR (variable). This
                means that if you borrow money and don't pay it back in full
                each month, you'll pay interest on the outstanding balance. The
                rate you're offered will depend on your individual credit
                history and circumstances, with rates starting from 28.9% APR
                (variable) for those with stronger credit profiles.

              <p className="text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 mb-6 text-left">
                One of the card's key benefits is that there's no annual fee,
                meaning you won't be charged simply for having the card. This
                makes it more affordable than many alternatives, particularly
                for those building their credit who may not use the card
                frequently. You may also be eligible for 0% interest on balance
                transfers and purchases for the first 6 months, though balance
                transfers will be subject to a 2.9% fee.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 mb-6 text-left">
                To avoid interest charges altogether, aim to pay off your
                balance in full each month. If you can't clear the full amount,
                make at least the minimum payment shown on your statement to
                avoid late payment fees and damage to your credit score.

              <p className="text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 mb-6 text-left">
                One of the main reasons people choose the Ocean Credit Card is
                to rebuild or establish their credit history. Whether you've had
                credit problems in the past, you're new to credit, or you simply
                want to improve your score, this card can help—if used
                correctly.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 mb-6 text-left">
                Credit reference agencies look at several factors when
                calculating your credit score, including your payment history,
                credit utilisation, length of credit history, and the mix of
                credit types you have. The Ocean Credit Card can positively
                influence several of these factors. By making regular, on-time
                payments, you demonstrate reliability. By keeping your balance
                well below your credit limit, you show you're not overly reliant
                on credit. And by maintaining the account over time, you build a
                longer credit history.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 mb-6 text-left">
                Improving your credit score doesn't happen overnight, but with
                consistent responsible use over six to twelve months, many
                cardholders see noticeable improvements. A better credit score
                can open doors to more competitive interest rates on loans,
                mortgages, and other forms of credit in the future, potentially
                saving you thousands of pounds over time.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 mb-6 text-left">
                Ocean Finance considers all credit histories when assessing
                applications, making this card accessible even if you've been
                declined elsewhere. However, it's important to understand that
                approval isn't guaranteed, and you must meet certain eligibility
                criteria.

                a rewards card or a low-interest credit card from a major bank
                may be more suitable—though you'll typically need a good to
                excellent credit score to qualify for those products.
