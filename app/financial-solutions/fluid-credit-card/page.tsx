                  The Fluid Credit Card is specifically designed for UK
                  residents who want to take control of their credit card debt
                  and reduce the burden of high interest charges. When you're
                  struggling with a credit card balance where most of your
                  monthly repayments go towards interest rather than reducing
                  the principal amount, Fluid offers a practical solution. By
                  transferring your existing balance to a Fluid card, you can
                  take advantage of a 9-month interest-free period on the
                  transferred amount, allowing more of your repayments to go
                  towards clearing your debt and helping you get back on track
                  financially.

                </h2>

                <p className="text-left text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  The cornerstone benefit of the Fluid Credit Card is its 0%
                  interest rate on balance transfers for the first 9 months from
                  account opening. This promotional offer allows you to transfer
                  balances from other credit cards where you're currently paying
                  interest, and benefit from a substantial period without any
                  interest charges accruing on the transferred amount. A 3%
                  balance transfer fee applies to any amounts transferred, but
                  this is typically far less than the interest you would pay on
                  a standard credit card over the same period. This feature can
                  save you hundreds of pounds in interest charges, particularly
                  if you have a significant balance on high-APR credit cards.

                  Before committing to a full application, you can use Fluid's
                  FastCheck eligibility checker to see whether you're likely to
                  be approved for the card. This quick and easy process takes
                  just 60 seconds and uses a soft credit search, which means it
                  won't appear on your credit file and won't affect your credit
                  rating. This feature is particularly valuable as it allows you
                  to make an informed decision about applying without the risk
                  of a hard credit check impacting your score unnecessarily. The
                  FastCheck tool gives you confidence and transparency, helping
                  you avoid unsuccessful applications that could harm your
                  creditworthiness.

                  Fluid provides an interactive calculator on their website that
                  helps you understand exactly how much you could save by
                  transferring your balance. By entering your current balance,
                  your existing interest rate, and your planned monthly
                  repayment amount, you can see a clear illustration of the
                  potential interest savings compared to keeping your balance on
                  your current card. This transparency helps you make an
                  informed decision about whether a balance transfer to Fluid is
                  the right financial move for your circumstances. The
                  calculator demonstrates how the 0% promotional period allows
                  more of your money to go towards reducing your actual debt
                  rather than servicing interest charges.

                  To take advantage of the 0% balance transfer offer, you must
                  request the transfer within the first 60 days of opening your

                  and can be initiated through the Online Account Manager or by
                  contacting Fluid's customer service team. You'll need to
                  provide details of the credit cards you wish to transfer
                  balances from, including account numbers and the amounts you
                  want to transfer. The maximum balance you can transfer cannot
                  exceed 90% of your credit limit (including the 3% balance
                  transfer fee), ensuring you maintain some available credit on
                  your Fluid card.

                      made within the first 60 days of account opening for new
                      customers. After the promotional period ends, your
