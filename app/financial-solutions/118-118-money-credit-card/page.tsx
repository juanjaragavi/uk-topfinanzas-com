                  The 118 118 Money Credit Card is specifically designed for UK
                  consumers who are looking to build or rebuild their credit
                  score. Whether you're new to credit, recovering from financial
                  difficulties, or simply looking to improve your credit rating,
                  this card provides a straightforward path to better credit
                  health. With its guaranteed personalised credit limit and
                  transparent terms, you'll know exactly where you stand from
                  the outset.

                  One of the standout features of the 118 118 Money Credit Card
                  is the eligibility checker, which allows you to see what
                  credit limit you'll be offered before completing a full
                  application. This soft search doesn't impact your credit
                  score, giving you complete transparency and confidence before
                  you commit. The guaranteed personalised credit limit means
                  there are no surprises—what you're offered is what you'll
                  receive if your application is approved.
                </p>

                <p className="text-left text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  This approach is particularly valuable for those who may have
                  been declined for credit in the past or are concerned about
                  the impact of multiple credit applications on their credit
                  file. By checking your eligibility first, you can make an
                  informed decision about whether to proceed with a full
                  application.
