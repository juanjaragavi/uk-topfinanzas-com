                  The Aqua Credit Card has established itself as a trusted
                  credit-building solution for UK consumers looking to improve
                  or rebuild their credit score. Whether you're new to credit,
                  recovering from past financial difficulties, or simply seeking
                  to strengthen your credit profile, Aqua provides a supportive
                  pathway to better financial health. With its focus on
                  accessibility, personalised features, and comprehensive
                  security, this card is designed to help you succeed.

                  Smart Credit Building Features
                </h2>

                <p className="text-left text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  One of the standout features of the Aqua Credit Card is its
                  commitment to helping you build credit through intelligent,
                  personalised features. Unlike traditional cards with fixed
                  limits, Aqua adjusts your credit limit based on how well you
                  manage your account. This means that responsible use—such as
                  making regular payments and keeping your balance under
                  control—can lead to credit limit increases over time,
                  demonstrating to credit reference agencies that you're a
                  reliable borrower.
                </p>

                <p className="text-left text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  The Aqua app provides free credit score updates, allowing you
                  to track your progress as you build your credit. Understanding
                  your credit score and how your financial behaviour affects it
                  is crucial for long-term financial success. Aqua empowers you
                  with this information, helping you make informed decisions
                  about your spending and repayment habits.

                  Understanding How Credit Cards Work
                </h2>

                <p className="text-left text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  Credit cards work by lending you up to a maximum amount known
                  as a credit limit. Your credit limit with Aqua is personalised
                  to your circumstances and it could grow over time if you
                  manage your account well. Whether you need to make payments
                  online, at the shops, or in your favourite restaurant, a
                  credit card offers a flexible way to borrow money as and when
                  you need it.
                </p>

                <p className="text-left text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  If you only use your account for purchases and pay back what
                  you borrow in full each month, you usually won't pay interest.
                  Alternatively, if you prefer, you can carry forward your
                  balance and pay interest each month. Bear in mind that you
                  must still pay at least your minimum monthly payment—and more
                  when you're able to—to keep your account in good standing and
                  continue building your credit.

                  Comprehensive Security and Fraud Protection
                </h2>

                <p className="text-left text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  Security is a top priority with the Aqua Credit Card. The card
                  comes with 24/7 fraud protection to help keep your account
                  safe from unauthorised transactions. Aqua's dedicated security
                  team monitors your account for suspicious activity, and if
                  anything unusual is detected, you'll be contacted immediately.
                  This proactive approach to security gives you peace of mind,
                  knowing that your finances are protected around the clock.

                <p className="text-left text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  Additionally, Aqua's friendly support team is available
                  whenever you need assistance. Whether you have questions about
                  your account, need help with a transaction, or require support
                  with fraud concerns, you can reach out to Aqua's customer
                  service team for prompt and helpful assistance. This level of
                  support is particularly valuable for those who may be new to
                  credit cards or rebuilding their credit.

                  The Aqua Classic credit card has a representative APR of 34.9%
                  (variable). The APR applicable to your account will depend on
                  Aqua's assessment of your application. Credit is available
                  only to UK residents aged 18 and over, subject to status.

                  (variable) and make no further purchases or cash withdrawals,
                  making the minimum monthly repayments would result in total
                  interest charges. It's important to pay more than the minimum
                  payment whenever possible to reduce the overall interest you
                  pay and to pay off your balance more quickly.
