                when assessing applications, making it a viable option for many
                people who may have been declined elsewhere. However, there are

                    If you're offered a credit limit of £1,200 at the
                    representative APR of 39.9% (variable) and you maintain an
                    average balance throughout the year without making
                    additional purchases or payments beyond the minimum, you
                    would pay approximately £479 in interest over 12 months.

                    This is a simplified example for illustration purposes. Your
                    actual costs will depend on your individual borrowing,
                    repayment behaviour, and the rate you're offered.

              <p className="text-base leading-7 text-gray-700 mb-6 text-left">
                To minimise interest charges, aim to pay off your full balance
                each month. If this isn't possible, paying more than the minimum
                payment will reduce the interest you pay and help you clear your
                debt faster.

                    What credit score do I need for the Ocean Credit Card?

                  <p className="text-base text-gray-700 text-left">
                    There's no specific credit score requirement published by
                    Ocean Finance or Capital One. The Ocean Credit Card is
                    designed for people with a range of credit histories,
                    including those with poor or limited credit. QuickCheck will
                    give you an indication of whether you're likely to be
                    accepted before you apply.

                    Will QuickCheck affect my credit score?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-base text-gray-700 text-left">
                    No, QuickCheck uses a soft search that doesn't affect your
                    credit score. Only you can see this check on your credit
                    report; it's not visible to other lenders. However, if you
                    proceed with the full application, a hard credit search will
                    be conducted, which will be visible on your credit file.

                  <p className="text-base text-gray-700 text-left">
                    Yes, the Ocean Credit Card is designed to be accessible to
                    people with all types of credit histories, including those
                    with bad credit. Ocean Finance considers all credit
                    histories when assessing applications, though approval is
                    not guaranteed and depends on your individual circumstances.

                  <p className="text-base text-gray-700 text-left">
                    If your application is approved, you can expect to receive
                    your Ocean Credit Card within 10 working days. The card will

                    What happens if I'm declined?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-base text-gray-700 text-left">
                    If your full application is declined, you'll receive a
                    letter explaining the reasons. You have the right to request
                    more details from Capital One. Being declined doesn't
                    necessarily mean you can't get credit elsewhere, but it's
                    worth understanding why you were declined before applying
                    for other products. Consider checking your credit report for
                    errors and taking steps to improve your credit score before
                    reapplying.

                    Can I increase my credit limit?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-base text-gray-700 text-left">
                    Once you've held the card for a while and demonstrated
                    responsible use, you may be able to request a credit limit
                    increase. Capital One typically reviews accounts
                    periodically and may offer increases automatically. You can
                    also request an increase through your online account or by
                    contacting customer services.

                    There's no specific minimum income requirement published for

                    your income and expenditure. The affordability assessment

                <p>
                  <strong>Credit Provider:</strong> Credit is provided by
                  Capital One. Ocean Finance (Intelligent Lending Ltd) acts as a
                  credit broker and is authorised and regulated by the Financial
                  Conduct Authority (FCA).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Representative APR:</strong> 39.9% (variable).
                  Representative example: Representative APR 39.9% (variable),
                  purchase rate 39.94% APR (variable), assumed credit limit
                  £1,200. Your rate may differ based on your individual
                  circumstances and credit history, with rates starting from
                  28.9% APR (variable).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Credit Agreement:</strong> By applying and accepting a
                  credit card, you'll enter into a legally binding credit
                  agreement with Capital One. You must repay the amount borrowed
                  plus any interest and charges according to the terms of the
                  agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Impact on Credit Score:</strong> Missing payments or
                  making only minimum payments can damage your credit score and
                  increase the amount of interest you pay. Late or missed
                  payments may also result in additional charges and collection
                  action.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Responsible Borrowing:</strong> Only borrow what you
                  can afford to repay. Credit cards can be useful financial
                  tools when used responsibly, but they can lead to unmanageable
                  debt if used carelessly.
