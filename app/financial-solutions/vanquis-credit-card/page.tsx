                  Credit Builder Credit Card: Your Path to Better Credit

                  The Vanquis Credit Builder Card is specifically designed to
                  help you build or rebuild your credit score through
                  responsible card usage. Recognised with multiple industry
                  awards including Credit Builder Card Provider of the Year at
                  the prestigious Moneyfacts Awards for three consecutive years
                  (2023, 2024, and 2025), this card demonstrates Vanquis's
                  commitment to helping customers improve their financial
                  standing. The card works on a simple principle: by staying
                  within your personalised credit limit of £250-£2,500, paying
                  on time, and paying at least the minimum monthly amount, you
                  can demonstrate positive credit behaviour that's reported to
                  credit reference agencies, potentially improving your credit
                  score over time.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  The Representative APR for the Credit Builder Card is 37.9%
                  (variable), though your actual APR and credit limit may vary
                  based on your individual circumstances. Vanquis is transparent
                  about only offering credit cards to people they believe can
                  afford the repayments, taking a responsible lending approach
                  that considers your financial situation holistically. This
                  card is particularly valuable for those with limited credit
                  history, past credit issues, or anyone looking to demonstrate
                  improved financial management to future lenders.

                  Balance Transfer Card: Consolidate and Save

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  For those managing existing credit card debt, the Vanquis
                  Balance Transfer Card offers a strategic solution with 0%
                  interest on balance transfers for up to 19 months (subject to
                  eligibility). This promotional period applies to balance
                  transfers made within 60 days of account opening, allowing you
                  to consolidate higher-interest debt from other cards and
                  potentially save significantly on interest charges whilst
                  paying down your balance. A 3.9% balance transfer fee applies
                  to transferred amounts, so if you transfer £900 (90% of a
                  £1,000 limit), a £35.10 fee would be added to your balance.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  The Balance Transfer Card offers credit limits ranging from
                  £250 to £7,000, personalised based on your circumstances. The
                  Representative APR is 36.9% (variable), though your specific
                  APR, credit limit, and promotional offer may vary based on
                  your individual assessment. The minimum transfer amount is
                  £100, and you can transfer up to 90% of your credit limit.
                  After the promotional period ends, the standard variable
                  purchase rate applies to any remaining balance, making it
                  important to plan your repayment strategy during the
                  interest-free period.

                  detailed transaction history with categorised spending
                  insights, make payments at any time, and set up convenient

                  can choose a payment date that suits your financial schedule,
                  helping ensure you never miss a payment – critical for

                  How Vanquis Can Help Improve Your Credit Score
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  Improving your credit score with a Vanquis Credit Card depends
                  on demonstrating responsible credit management over time.
                  Vanquis reports your account activity to credit reference
                  agencies, meaning your positive behaviour can help build a
                  stronger credit profile. The three key principles for credit
                  building success are: staying within your credit limit, paying
                  on time every month, and paying at least the minimum monthly
                  amount (though paying more accelerates debt clearance and
                  score improvement).
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light text-left">
                  The Vanquis app makes following these principles easier by
                  helping you track spending to avoid exceeding your limit, set
                  up Direct Debits to ensure you never miss a payment date, and
                  choose flexible payment options including minimum, fixed, or
                  full balance payments. By consistently demonstrating you can
                  manage credit responsibly, you provide evidence to future
                  lenders that you're a reliable borrower, potentially opening
                  doors to better credit products and interest rates over time.
                  Many customers start with a Vanquis card precisely because
                  traditional lenders have declined them, then use it as a
                  stepping stone to rebuild their creditworthiness.

                  <strong>Important:</strong> Credit is subject to status,
                  affordability, and credit checks. Credit is only available to
                  UK residents aged 18 and over. Vanquis Bank Limited is

                  <strong>Credit Building Advice:</strong> Staying within your
                  credit limit demonstrates financial discipline. Paying on time
                  every month is essential for building a positive credit
                  history. Paying more than the minimum amount – with a fixed
                  monthly payment or ideally the full balance – can help you
                  clear debt faster and potentially boost your credit score more
                  quickly.
