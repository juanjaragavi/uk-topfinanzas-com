                  First Direct has built its reputation on straightforward
                  banking and exceptional customer service, and the 1st Credit
                  Card continues this tradition. Designed for customers who
                  value simplicity and transparency, this card offers a
                  competitive package without complicated rewards schemes or
                  hidden fees. Whether you're planning a significant purchase or
                  looking for a reliable everyday credit card, the First Direct
                  1st Credit Card delivers clarity and value.

                <p className="text-left text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  The standout feature of the First Direct 1st Credit Card is
                  the generous 12-month 0% interest period on purchases. This
                  introductory offer allows you to spread the cost of essential
                  purchases—from home improvements to major appliances—without
                  paying interest during your first year. Whether you're
                  furnishing a new home, upgrading technology, or covering
                  unexpected expenses, this interest-free period provides
                  valuable financial flexibility. After the introductory period
                  ends, a competitive standard rate applies, with existing First
                  Direct customers often benefiting from preferential rates.

                <p className="text-left text-gray-800 mb-4 text-md leading-5 font-light">
                  Unlike many credit cards that charge annual fees, the First
                  Direct 1st Credit Card comes with no annual fee whatsoever.
                  This means you keep more of your money and can use the card as
                  much or as little as suits your needs without worrying about
                  justifying an annual charge. For those who want a reliable
                  credit card without ongoing costs, this feature makes the
                  First Direct card an attractive proposition, particularly when
                  combined with its competitive interest rates and excellent
                  service standards.

                  Representative 24.9% APR (variable). Representative example:
                  If you borrow £1,200 at a purchase rate of 24.9% p.a.
                  (variable) and make 12 monthly payments of £112.01, you will
                  pay back £1,344.12 in total. The total cost of credit will be
                  £144.12. Interest is charged from the date of each transaction
                  unless you pay your balance in full within the interest-free
                  period or payment due date. After the 0% introductory period,
                  interest will be charged on outstanding balances.

                  The First Direct 1st Credit Card is particularly suitable for
                  those who value straightforward banking, excellent customer
                  service, and competitive rates without unnecessary
                  complications. It's ideal if you're planning a significant
                  purchase and want interest-free time to pay it off, or if
                  you're an existing First Direct customer looking to benefit
                  from potentially lower rates. The lack of an annual fee makes
                  it cost-effective for regular use, whilst the 24/7 customer
                  service provides peace of mind that help is always available
                  when you need it. This card suits customers who appreciate
                  First Direct's digital-first approach and want a reliable,
                  well-supported credit card that does exactly what it says on
                  the tin.
