                  NatWest offers competitive interest rates, with representative
                  APRs starting from 3.9% for loans between £7,500 and £15,000
                  (subject to status and loan amount). The bank emphasizes
                  transparency, providing clear information about rates and fees
                  upfront. Loan payments are fixed for the duration of the term,
                  offering predictability for budgeting and financial planning,

                  Recognizing that financial circumstances differ, NatWest
                  provides flexible repayment terms ranging from 1 to 8 years.
                  This allows borrowers to choose a repayment plan that aligns
                  with their monthly budget. A longer term can result in lower
                  monthly payments, making the loan more manageable day-to-day,
                  while a shorter term helps reduce the total amount of interest
                  paid over the loan's lifetime.
