                  Managing your Zopa Credit Card is refreshingly simple thanks
                  to the intuitive mobile app. View your PIN instantly whenever

                  customer service. Download statements with just a few taps,
                  track your spending with visual breakdowns, and receive
                  real-time balance updates after every transaction. The app
                  also features spending tracking that categorizes your
                  purchases, helping you understand your financial habits at a
                  glance.

                  Setting up automatic payments is straightforward, ensuring you
                  never miss a payment deadline. The app sends instant payment
                  notifications, so you're always aware of account activity. If
                  you spot any unusual transactions, you can instantly freeze
                  your card through the app, providing an important layer of
                  security and fraud protection. This comprehensive approach to
                  card management puts complete control in your hands, wherever

                  One of Zopa's most innovative features is the Credit Cushion,
                  a unique tool that helps you prepare for life's surprises.
                  This feature allows you to set aside a portion of your
                  available credit balance, keeping it separate from your
                  day-to-day spending limit. You choose the amount that works
                  for you, and Zopa keeps it reserved specifically for
                  emergencies or unexpected expenses.

                  or last-minute travel requirement. This thoughtful feature
                  helps you maintain better financial discipline by separating
                  your regular spending power from your emergency reserve,
                  reducing the temptation to dip into funds meant for
                  contingencies. It's financial planning made simple, built
                  right into your credit card.

                  use them abroad, Zopa doesn't add any extra charges for
                  foreign purchases. Whether you're shopping in Paris, dining in

                  pay the exchange rate without additional fees.

                  you significant amounts on trips abroad, especially if you

                  instant payment notifications and the ability to freeze your
                  card if needed, you can travel with confidence knowing your

                  The Zopa Credit Card operates on a variable interest rate
                  structure, with rates starting from 29.2% APR. The
                  representative example shows a 34.9% representative APR
                  variable based on an assumed credit limit of £1,200, with a
                  34.9% p.a. variable purchase rate. It's important to note that
                  the actual rate and credit limit you receive will depend on
                  your individual financial circumstances and credit assessment.

                  Credit is subject to status, affordability, and applicable
                  terms and conditions. Zopa will conduct a credit check as part

                  score. However, you can check your eligibility with no impact
                  to your credit score before making a full application. For
