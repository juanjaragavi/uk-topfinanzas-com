                  What truly sets The Co-operative Bank apart is its unwavering

                  customer-led Ethical Policy in 1992, the bank has given
                  customers a voice in how their money is used. Unlike many
                  traditional banks, The Co-operative Bank understands the power
                  your money holds in making positive differences to the planet,
                  its people, and our communities. When you use this credit
                  card, you're not just making purchases—you're supporting a
                  bank that stands up for causes that matter, from environmental

                  purchases and balance transfers, providing consistency and
                  transparency in how interest is calculated. The card comes
                  with no annual fee and no balance transfer fee, making it an
                  excellent choice for those looking to consolidate existing
                  credit card debt or simply manage their spending more

                <p className="text-left text-gray-800 text-sm leading-5 mb-4">
                  <strong>Representative Example:</strong> 18.2% APR
                  representative (variable). Based on an assumed credit limit of
                  £1,200 and a purchase rate of 18.2% per annum (variable). This
                  means if you borrow £1,200 and make no additional purchases or
                  payments, you would be charged interest at 18.2% per annum on
                  the outstanding balance.

                  Please note that approval is subject to status and based on a
                  credit check and assessment of your personal circumstances. A
                  minimum annual income of £10,000 is required, and you must be
                  a Co-op Member to apply. Cash withdrawals incur a fee of 3% of
                  the amount withdrawn (minimum £3), and cash withdrawals abroad
                  incur an additional 2.75% currency conversion fee. Missing
                  payments or exceeding your credit limit may result in charges
                  of £10 per occurrence.

                    can lead to persistent debt and increased interest charges
