                  What is a Credit Card?
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-sm leading-5 font-light">
                  A credit card is much more than just a piece of plastic in
                  your wallet. It’s a financial tool that, if used correctly,
                  can be a great ally in managing your finances. Essentially, a
                  credit card allows you to make purchases or withdraw cash up
                  to a limit set by the issuer, with the promise to repay that
                  amount plus any interest that may apply.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-sm leading-5 font-light">
                  Unlike debit cards, where money is directly withdrawn from
                  your bank account, a credit card offers temporary credit. The
                  bank or financial institution lends you money for your
                  purchases, which you’ll need to repay within the agreed
                  period, usually each month. This mechanism offers flexibility
                  and, in some cases, benefits like rewards or purchase
                  protections. However, it requires responsibility: smart and
                  controlled use is key to avoiding unnecessary debt.

                    <strong>Credit Limit:</strong> This is the maximum amount
                    you can spend with your card. It’s important not to
                    consistently spend up to the limit (high credit utilisation)
                    as this can negatively impact your credit score.

                    <strong>Interest Rate (APR):</strong> This is the cost of
                    borrowing. If you pay your full balance before the payment
                    due date each month, you generally won’t incur any interest
                    on purchases thanks to the grace period.{" "}

                    21-25 days). Pay your statement balance in full by the due

                    <strong>High-Interest Debt:</strong> If you don’t pay the
                    full balance each month, interest can accumulate quickly,
                    making debt hard to manage.

                    <strong>Negative Credit Impact:</strong> Late payments,

                    repay.

                    <strong>Pay the Full Balance Each Month:</strong> This is
                    the best way to avoid interest charges entirely.

                    <strong>
                      If You Can't Pay in Full, Pay More Than the Minimum:
                    </strong>{" "}
                    Paying only the minimum extends the repayment period
                    significantly and maximizes interest costs.

                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Create and Stick to a Budget:</strong> Track your
                    spending to ensure you can afford your credit card
                    repayments.

                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Use Payment Alerts:</strong> Set up reminders or
                    direct debits (for at least the minimum payment) to avoid
                    missing due dates.

                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Keep Credit Utilisation Low:</strong> Aim to use
                    less than 30% of your available credit limit on each card
                    and across all cards.
