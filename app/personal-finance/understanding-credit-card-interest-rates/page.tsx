                  What Are Credit Card Interest Rates?
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-sm leading-5 font-light">
                  The interest rate on a credit card represents the cost charged
                  by financial institutions for borrowed money when you don’t
                  pay the total balance at the end of each billing cycle.
                  Expressed as an Annual Percentage Rate (APR), interest accrues
                  monthly based on unpaid balances. A crucial aspect is the
                  grace period, usually 21 to 30 days after the billing cycle
                  ends, where no interest is charged if the total balance is
                  paid.

                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-sm leading-5 font-light">
                  Interest applies to the card’s outstanding balance. Typically,
                  interest is calculated daily based on the APR, which is
                  divided by 365 days. For example, with an APR of 18% and a
                  balance of 1,000 currency units, daily interest might add
                  approximately 0.49 currency units, which accumulates over the
                  month if unpaid.

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-sm leading-5 font-light">
                  Several factors influence the interest rate a bank or card

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-sm leading-5 font-light text-gray-800">
                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Credit History:</strong> A higher credit score can
                    result in lower interest rates. Lenders assess your
                    repayment history, outstanding debts, and overall financial
                    responsibility to determine your risk level.
                  </li>
                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Card Type:</strong> Rewards credit cards typically
                    have slightly higher APRs due to the added benefits they
                    offer. Many consumers choose these cards to maximize their
                    spending efficiency, especially on frequent purchases.
                    Despite the rewards, it’s important to pay the full balance
                    each month to avoid accumulating interest.

                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Market Conditions:</strong> Rates can be affected by
                    central bank policies. When interest rates rise across the
                    economy, credit card APRs typically increase as well,
                    impacting borrowing costs.

                  The interest rate on a credit card significantly impacts your

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-sm leading-5 font-light">
                  The minimum monthly payment typically includes a portion of
                  the principal and accrued interest. Higher interest rates mean
                  more of the minimum payment goes to cover interest rather than
                  the debt itself.

                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-sm leading-5 font-light">
                  The higher the interest rate, the more expensive the total
                  cost for goods or services if the balance isn’t fully paid
                  each month. This effect accumulates through compounding
                  interest.
