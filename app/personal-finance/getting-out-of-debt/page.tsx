                  Build an Emergency Fund
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-sm leading-5 font-light">
                  While it seems counterintuitive when focusing on debt, having
                  a small emergency fund is crucial. It prevents you from
                  falling further into debt when unexpected costs arise (e.g.,
                  boiler repair, car breakdown).

                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Start Small:</strong> Aim for a modest initial goal,
                    perhaps £500 or £1,000, even while tackling debt. This
                    provides a buffer.

                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Save Automatically:</strong> Set up a small, regular
                    standing order to a separate savings account.

                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Prioritise:</strong> Some experts suggest building
                    this small emergency fund *before* aggressively paying off
                    non-priority debts (like credit cards) using the
                    snowball/avalanche method, while still making minimum
                    payments on everything. High-priority debts (rent/mortgage,
                    council tax, utilities) must always be paid first.
