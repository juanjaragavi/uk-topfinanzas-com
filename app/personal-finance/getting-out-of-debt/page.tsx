                        <li>
                          Focus on paying off the smallest debt while making

                        <li>
                          Once you eliminate the smallest debt, the money you

                    The choice between the snowball and avalanche method depends

                      <strong>Communicate early and honestly:</strong> Don’t
                      wait until your debts accumulate or payments are
                      excessively delayed. As soon as you know you’ll have
                      trouble meeting payments, contact your creditors. Explain
                      your situation clearly and honestly, stating your
                      intention to pay but your need for better terms.

                        <li>
                          Reduced interest rates: This allows you to reduce your
                          balance more efficiently and pay less interest in the
                          future.

                        <li>
                          Waiving late fees: If you’ve struggled, late fees can
                          make things worse. Request that they be waived or
                          reduced.

                        <li>
                          More flexible payment plans: Some creditors are
                          willing to extend the payment term or allow smaller
                          payments (perhaps temporarily) to help you stabilize
                          your situation.

                      communications (dates, times, names). Any agreement you
                      reach should be confirmed in writing to prevent future
                      misunderstandings. Save emails, letters, and any proof of
                      the new agreed-upon terms.

                    a car repair or boiler breakdown.

                      like saving £500 or £1,000. This will give you a cushion
