            Benefits of No Annual Fee Cards
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-sm leading-5 font-light">
            The primary advantage is cost savings – you avoid paying a yearly
            charge just for holding the card. However, many no-fee cards still
            offer compelling benefits:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm leading-5 font-light text-gray-800">
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Cashback Rewards</span> Earn a
              percentage back on your purchases, either as a flat rate on
              everything or higher rates in specific categories like groceries,
              dining, or fuel.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Rewards Points/Miles</span> Some cards
              offer points or miles instead of cashback, which can be redeemed
              for travel, merchandise, or statement credits.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Introductory Offers</span> Many no-fee
              cards come with 0% introductory APR periods on purchases or
              balance transfers, helping you save on interest for a limited
              time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Credit Building</span> For those new
              to credit or looking to improve their score, several no-fee cards
              are designed specifically for this purpose, often with more
              accessible approval requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Travel Perks</span> While less common
              than premium cards, some no-fee options include benefits like no
              foreign transaction fees, which is great for international travel.

            No-annual-fee cards come in various forms, catering to different

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm leading-5 font-light text-gray-800">
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Flat-Rate Cashback Cards</span> These
              offer a simple, consistent cashback percentage (e.g., 1% or 1.5%)
              on all purchases, making them easy to understand and use.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Tiered/Category Cashback Cards</span>{" "}
              These provide higher cashback rates (e.g., 3% or 5%) in specific
              spending categories that might rotate quarterly or be chosen by
              the cardholder. They are best suited for those whose spending
              aligns with the bonus categories.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Balance Transfer Cards</span> Often
              feature long 0% intro APR periods specifically for transferring
              balances from other high-interest cards, helping users manage and
              pay down debt more affordably.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Student Cards</span> Designed for
              students with limited credit history, these cards often have lower
              credit limits but provide an opportunity to build credit
              responsibly while potentially earning modest rewards.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Basic/Credit Builder Cards</span>{" "}
              Focused primarily on establishing or rebuilding credit, these
              cards may have fewer rewards but offer a pathway to better credit
              scores with responsible use.

              choice. If your spending is concentrated in specific areas (like
              dining or groceries), a category cashback card might yield higher
