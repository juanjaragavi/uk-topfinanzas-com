                  Types of Cashback Credit Cards
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4 text-sm leading-5 font-light">
                  Cashback cards generally fall into a few categories:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-sm leading-5 font-light text-gray-800">
                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Flat-Rate Cashback Cards:</strong> These cards offer
                    a straightforward approach, providing a fixed percentage
                    (e.g., 1%, 1.5%, or even 2% on purchases and payments) back
                    on every purchase, regardless of the category. They are
                    simple to understand and require no effort to track
                    categories. Ideal for those who value simplicity and
                    consistent rewards across all spending.
                  </li>
                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Tiered/Category Cashback Cards:</strong> These cards
                    offer higher cashback rates (often 3% to 5%) in specific
                    spending categories, such as groceries, dining, fuel, or
                    travel. Some cards have rotating categories that change
                    quarterly, while others allow you to choose your bonus
                    categories. These cards can be highly rewarding if your
                    spending aligns well with the bonus categories, but require
                    more attention to maximize earnings.
                  </li>
                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Cards with Introductory Offers:</strong> Many
                    cashback cards, including flat-rate and category-based ones,
                    attract new customers with 0% introductory APR periods on
                    purchases or balance transfers. This can be valuable for
                    financing large purchases interest-free or consolidating
                    existing debt while still earning cashback rewards.

                    <strong>Cashback Rate:</strong> Compare the percentage
                    offered. Is it a flat rate or tiered? Do bonus categories
                    match your spending?
                  </li>
                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Annual Fee:</strong> Many excellent cashback cards
                    have no annual fee, maximizing your savings. If a card does
                    have a fee, ensure the rewards and benefits outweigh the
                    cost.
                  </li>
                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Welcome Bonus:</strong> Some cards offer a sign-up
                    bonus after meeting an initial spending requirement,
                    providing extra value upfront.
                  </li>
                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Redemption Options:</strong> How can you redeem your
                    cashback? Options often include statement credits, direct
                    bank deposits, gift cards, or travel rewards. Look for
                    flexibility and ease of redemption.

                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Introductory APR:</strong> If you plan to make a
                    large purchase or transfer a balance, look for cards with a
                    0% intro APR offer. Check the duration of the offer and the
                    standard APR that applies afterward.

                  <li className="mb-2">
                    <strong>Other Benefits:</strong> Consider additional perks
                    like purchase protection, travel insurance (less common on
                    cashback cards), or access to credit monitoring tools.
