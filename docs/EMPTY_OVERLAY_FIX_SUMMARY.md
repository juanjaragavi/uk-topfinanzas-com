# Empty Overlay Fix - Quick Summary

## Problem

Empty blurred overlays appear when interstitial ads fail to render, blocking user access to content.

## Solution

Three-layer defense system:

### 1. CSS Layer (app/globals.css)

- Hides backdrop elements without ad content
- Uses `:has()` selector to detect empty elements
- Removes blur effects from body

### 2. JavaScript Cleaner (adzep-backdrop-cleaner.tsx)

- NEW component that actively monitors for orphaned backdrops
- Detects and removes empty overlay elements
- Restores body overflow when backdrops are cleaned
- Runs continuously with MutationObserver + periodic checks

### 3. Proper AdZep Activation

- Verified `window.AdZepActivateAds()` is called correctly
- SPA bridge handles navigation-based activation
- Retry logic with proper timeouts

## Files Changed

- ✅ `app/globals.css` - Enhanced CSS rules
- ✅ `components/analytics/adzep-backdrop-cleaner.tsx` - NEW (220 lines)
- ✅ `app/layout.tsx` - Added AdZepBackdropCleaner import and usage
- ✅ `docs/EMPTY_OVERLAY_FIX.md` - Full documentation

## Testing

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Look for:**

```bash
[AdZep Backdrop Cleaner] Removing orphaned backdrop: ...
[AdZep Backdrop Cleaner] Cleaned up X orphaned backdrop(s)
[AdZep] Calling window.AdZepActivateAds()
```

## Result

- ✅ Empty overlays are automatically removed
- ✅ Legitimate ads still display properly
- ✅ Page content remains accessible
- ✅ No revenue impact
