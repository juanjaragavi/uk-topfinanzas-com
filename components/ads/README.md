# Advertisement Components

## Overview

This directory contains advertisement management components for the application, including TopAds integration and local advertisement content.

## Components

### TopAds Integration

#### `topads-placement.tsx`

Reusable components for TopAds ad placements with pre-configured variants:

- `TopAdsPlacement` - Generic component for custom ad placements
- `TopAdsSquare` - Pre-configured square ad (300x250)
- `TopAdsLeaderboard` - Pre-configured leaderboard ad (728x90)
- `TopAdsBanner` - Pre-configured banner ad (320x50)

**Example Usage:**

```

**See:** `/docs/TOPADS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for comprehensive documentation.

### Local Advertisement Components

Currently available components handle local advertisement content and management.

## Non-GAM Advertisement System

The application uses a local advertisement system defined in `/lib/ads/advertisements.ts` for managing promotional content without external ad networks.

### Local Advertisement Management

See `/lib/ads/advertisements.ts` for:

- Advertisement interface definitions
- Advertisement data management
- Filtering by format and status
- Random advertisement selection

## Implementation

Local advertisements are displayed through custom components that load static promotional content rather than external ad networks.

## Note

Google Ad Manager (GAM) components have been removed from this directory as part of the migration away from external ad networks.
