## **Task: Replicate Ad Placement Across Credit Card Blog Posts**

**Context:**

* We have implemented a specific ad placement strategy for blog posts detailing credit card products.
* Each credit card product is covered by two separate pages:

1. An **information page** (e.g., product details, benefits).
2. A **requirements page** (e.g., eligibility criteria, application process).

* Three distinct advertisement units have been strategically integrated across these two pages for each product.

**Reference Implementation:**

The ad placement is already complete for the following two credit card products:

1. **Barclaycard Avios Plus:**

    * Information Page: @/app/financial-solutions/barclaycard-avios-plus/page.tsx
    * Requirements Page: @/app/financial-solutions/barclaycard-avios-plus-requirements/page.tsx

2. **Halifax World Elite Mastercard:**

    * Information Page: @/app/financial-solutions/halifax-world-elite-mastercard/page.tsx
    * Requirements Page: @/app/financial-solutions/halifax-world-elite-mastercard-requirements/page.tsx

**Objective:**

* Apply the identical three-advertisement placement strategy used in the reference examples above to the remaining nine credit card blog posts.
* These posts are located within the @/app/financial-solutions/ directory. Ensure each of the nine products (represented by their respective information and requirements pages) receives the same ad treatment.

**Important:**

Below, is an example of a complete ad. These are the elements that should be copied and pasted in the remaining blog posts:

```jsx
<div className="my-8">
<Link href="/personal-finance/credit-card-types-benefits/">
<Image
src="https://media.topfinanzas.com/images/ads/Top-Blog-Credit-Cards.png"
alt="Barclaycard Avios Plus Credit Card"
width={1000}
height={563}
className="mx-auto w-full md:w-8/12 h-auto rounded-lg"

</Link>
</div>
