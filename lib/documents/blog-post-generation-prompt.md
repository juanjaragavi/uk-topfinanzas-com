    ## Important

    - The full context and details for this topic, such as the Tentative Title and Content Focus, are located in the corresponding CSV row within the @/lib/documents/topfinanzas-us-topic-outline.csv file.
    - Before generating the content, review the sitemap for the UK site to get an updated list of published pages and articles.
      - **UK Market:** [https://uk.topfinanzas.com/sitemap.xml](https://uk.topfinanzas.com/sitemap.xml)
    - Use the UK URLs to generate the links in each blog post.
    - If the "Funnel Stage" is TOFU, create the new blog post in the @/app/personal-finance category, matching the structure and layout used by existing articles in that directory, but write entirely new, original content.
    ```

## If "Is Pillar? \= Yes"

- Create an introductory and comprehensive article on the topic in the "Pillar" column.
- The article should cover: definition, importance, common mistakes, initial steps, and examples.
- Search the schema for all rows with "Is Pillar? \= No" and the same "Pillar".
- Link within the text to the articles listed in "Tentative Title".
- You can include them as recommended resources, complementary sections, or within bulleted lists.

## If "Is Pillar? \= No"

- Write an article based on the "Tentative Title", with the focus defined in "Content Focus" (category \+ page).
- Use the "Main Keyword" naturally in the title, introduction, and subheadings (without keyword stuffing). (metadata)
- Use the following structure:
  - SEO Title with the keyword (`<h1>`)
  - Engaging introduction that connects with the reader (`<p>`)
  - 2 to 3 subheadings (`<h2>` and `<h3>`) with explanatory paragraphs (`<p>`) and bullets if applicable
  - Conclusion with a summary and a smooth call to action (`<p>`)

## Rules for Both Article Types

- Add at least 2 internal links to existing pages on [https://uk.topfinanzas.com](https://uk.topfinanzas.com), choosing them according to the context of the text. (`<a>`)
- The language should be clear, accessible, and without unnecessary technical jargon.
- Use everyday examples when possible and maintain a fluid narrative.
- Do not use the word 'Conclusion' or 'Summary' in the title of the last paragraph.
