# ConvertKit Integration Restoration Summary

## Overview

The ConvertKit (Kit.com) subscriber integration has been reinstated alongside the existing Brevo and Google Sheets workflows that power the UK TopFinanzas credit card quiz. Incoming payloads continue to use the original Kit-style structure sent from the frontend, ensuring full backward compatibility with historical data submissions.

## Key Changes

1. **Shared Subscription Endpoint** (`app/api/subscribe/route.ts`)
   - Builds the existing Brevo payload (including dynamic `ext_id`) while simultaneously forwarding the original payload to ConvertKit.
   - Treats Brevo duplicate contacts (`duplicate_parameter`) as a successful outcome to keep the user flow uninterrupted.
   - Aggregates both provider results in the JSON response for easier observability.

2. **ConvertKit Client Utility** (`lib/kit/convertkit-client.ts`)
   - Provides a typed helper for calling `https://api.kit.com/v4/subscribers` with timeout protection and structured error reporting.
   - Accepts environment overrides but defaults to `KIT_API_KEY` (server-only) or the legacy `NEXT_PUBLIC_KIT_API_KEY` fallback.
   - Normalizes success scenarios to include 2xx, 409, and 422 responses to account for already-subscribed contacts.

3. **Environment Configuration** (`.env.example`)
   - Documents the new `KIT_API_KEY` server-side secret while retaining the legacy `NEXT_PUBLIC_KIT_API_KEY` entry for backward compatibility.

4. **Test Harness** (`scripts/test-full-flow.js`)
   - Executes the full multi-integration flow (Sheets ➜ Brevo ➜ ConvertKit) and reports individual provider outcomes.
   - Handles duplicate scenarios gracefully so repeated local runs still pass.

## Required Environment Variables

| Variable                  | Purpose                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `BREVO_API_KEY`           | Brevo contacts API authentication     |
| `KIT_API_KEY`             | ConvertKit subscriber API (preferred) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_KIT_API_KEY` | Fallback ConvertKit key (legacy)      |
| `KIT_API_URL`             | Optional override for ConvertKit API  |

> **Note:** Avoid committing real secrets. Update production/staging configuration to include `KIT_API_KEY` before deploying.

## Testing

Run the end-to-end validation after starting the dev server on port 3004:

```bash
node scripts/test-full-flow.js
```

Expected results:

- Google Sheets returns `201 Created` or `409 Duplicate`.
- Brevo returns `200 OK` or `400 duplicate_parameter` flagged as success.
- ConvertKit returns `200-201` (or duplicate success statuses).

Console output now surfaces the individual provider statuses to simplify troubleshooting.

## Operational Notes

- Frontend code (`components/credit-card-form*.tsx`) remains unchanged and continues to send the Kit-style payload.
- Monitoring can continue via Brevo dashboards and the ConvertKit subscriber list simultaneously.
- Additional analytics/tracking updates are not required; existing GTM/AdZep flows are unaffected.
- If ConvertKit credentials are missing, the API response includes `convertkit.success = false` while Brevo continues to operate.

## Next Steps

1. Confirm production environment variables are populated (`KIT_API_KEY`, `KIT_API_URL`).
2. Deploy to staging/production and monitor the first batch of quiz submissions in both Brevo and ConvertKit.
3. Update runbooks to reference the shared subscription endpoint and the new test script behaviour.
