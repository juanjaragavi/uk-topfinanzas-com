feat(financial-solutions): Establish mandatory layout standard for all product pages

Critical standardization implemented to enforce consistent layout across all Credit Card and Personal Loan product pages in /app/financial-solutions/.

**Standard Documentation Created:**
- Created .github/instructions/FINANCIAL_SOLUTIONS_LAYOUT_STANDARD.instructions.md (60+ sections)
- Comprehensive specification with exact element ordering for Benefits and Requirements pages
- Mandatory component usage patterns, typography standards, and forbidden elements list
- Validation checklist and migration guidelines included
- Template reference: /app/financial-solutions/barclaycard-avios-plus/ (both pages)

**Instruction Files Updated:**
- lib/CREDIT_CARD_PRODUCT_GENERATION.instructions.md: Added mandatory layout standard reference
- .github/instructions/BLOG_POST_INTEGRATION.instructions.md: Added Financial Solutions layout section
- .github/instructions/project-rules.instructions.md: Added section 3 on layout standard enforcement

**Non-Compliant Page Refactored:**
- /app/financial-solutions/nationwide-building-society-credit-card/page.tsx
- Removed: Colored background boxes, grid layouts, SVG icons, <ul> lists, special CTA boxes
- Implemented: ResponsiveImage, circular badge bullets, standard button styling, correct element ordering
- AI Content Disclaimer repositioned before footer (not after)

**Non-Compliant Pages Identified:**
- 7 additional pages require refactoring: hsbc-rewards, 118-118-money, ocean, tesco-bank-clubcard, american-express (2 pages)

**Key Standards Enforced:**
- Benefits pages MUST use ResponsiveImage for hero images
- Requirements pages MUST use Image (next/image) for hero images
- Hero image positioned AFTER "View Requirements" button on Benefits pages
- NO colored background boxes (bg-gray-50, bg-blue-50, bg-yellow-50)
- NO grid layouts for related articles (use simple boxed list)
- NO <ul> tag bullet lists (use circular badges with arrows)
- AI Content Disclaimer BEFORE footer on both pages
- Both ad units required: uk_topfinanzas_3 and uk_topfinanzas_4

**Performance Justification:**
- Layout validated against Google Analytics metrics
- Validated against Google Ads performance data
- Deviations negatively impact SEO, conversion rates, and analytics tracking

**Implementation Summary:**
- Created: docs/FINANCIAL_SOLUTIONS_STANDARDIZATION_SUMMARY.md

**Impact:**
- All future Financial Solutions pages will follow validated standard
- LLMs must read layout standard before generating pages
- Consistent user experience across 200+ product pages
- Maintained SEO performance and conversion optimization
