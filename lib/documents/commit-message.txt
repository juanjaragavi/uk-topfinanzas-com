refactor: Align Google Ad Manager implementation with official guidelines

- Feat: Centralize ad slot definitions in `GPTScriptManager` to ensure they are loaded in the `<head>`.
- Fix: Correctly define the interstitial ad as an out-of-page slot using `defineOutOfPageSlot`.
- Refactor: Simplify ad components (`enhanced-mobile-banner-ad`, `mobile-offerwall-ad`) to only handle ad display, removing slot definition logic.
- Chore: Remove the `MobileInterstitialAd` component from the layout and delete the corresponding file, as it is no longer needed and was causing incorrect behavior.
