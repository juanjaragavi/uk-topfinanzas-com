fix(convertkit): Send API key as a header

This commit resolves the authentication issue with the ConvertKit API by sending the API key as a header instead of in the request body.

Changes include:
- Updated `app/api/subscribe/route.ts` to include the `X-Kit-Api-Key` header in the request.
- Removed the `api_key` from the request body.
