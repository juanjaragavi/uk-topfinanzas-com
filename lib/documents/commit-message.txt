feat: Implement AdZep tag

This commit implements the AdZep tag in the Next.js project according to the provided instructions.

Changes include:
- Updated `app/layout.tsx`: Imported and added `AdZepLinkHandler` to ensure `window.AdZepActivateAds()` is called on all link clicks, in addition to page loads and navigation changes already handled by `AdZepNavigationHandler`.
- The `AdZep` component continues to load the AdZep script in the `<head>` section.
