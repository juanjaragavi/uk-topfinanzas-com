feat: Upgrade Next.js to v15 and React to v19

This commit upgrades the project's Next.js framework to the latest stable version (15.4.3) and React to 19.1.0.

Key changes include:
- Updated core Next.js and React dependencies in `package.json`.
- Applied Next.js codemods for automatic migration of API usages and font imports.
- Resolved `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ReactCurrentDispatcher')` by explicitly setting `react-dom` version.
- Fixed `conflicting public file and page file for /favicon.ico` error by removing the `app/api/favicon/route.ts` and adjusting `app/layout.tsx` to use `public/favicon.png` as the primary favicon.
- Addressed image warnings related to `fill` prop by ensuring parent elements have `position: relative` in `app/page.tsx`, `app/blog/page.tsx`, `app/personal-finance/page.tsx`, and `components/layout/header.tsx`.
- Removed deprecated `optimizeFonts` and `swcMinify` configurations from `next.config.mjs`.

The application now builds and runs locally without critical errors.
