feat: optimize ad placement and layout

Refactored the ad unit placement across multiple financial product pages to improve user experience and ad performance.

- Repositioned CTA buttons to appear above ad blocks for better visibility and user interaction.
- Increased spacing around ad units to create clearer visual separation from other content.
- Added horizontal rules as visual separators between ad units and surrounding elements.

These changes align with recommendations from the Google Ads Manager to enhance usability and prevent accidental ad clicks.
