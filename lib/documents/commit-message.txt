fix: Prevent AdZep overlay persistence on credit card product pages

- Add 3-second maximum timeout for overlay display in adzep-spa-bridge.tsx
- Implement proper cleanup of overlay timeout when hiding manually
- Add smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions to overlay.ts
- Make overlay more subtle (smaller dot, lighter color, slower animation)
- Add development logging to track overlay hide events

This fix addresses the issue where an empty overlay was appearing and persisting on credit card product articles (e.g., /financial-solutions/santander-uk-credit-card) shortly after page load.

**Root Cause:**
The overlay system had no maximum timeout and relied entirely on ad creative detection or verification retries (up to 6 seconds). If hasRenderedCreative() failed to detect ads properly, the overlay could persist indefinitely, creating a poor user experience.

**Solution:**
1. Added overlayTimeout ref to track 3-second maximum display time
2. Overlay now hides automatically after 3 seconds regardless of ad rendering status
3. Proper timeout cleanup when manually hiding overlay
4. Smooth fade transitions (opacity 0→1 on show, 1→0 on hide with 200ms delay)
5. More subtle visual design (8px dot, lighter gray, 1.5s animation, lower opacity)

**Overlay Lifecycle (After Fix):**
- Show → Fade in → Start 3s timeout → Wait for ad detection
- Whichever comes first triggers hide:
  * Ad detected → Clear timeout, hide immediately
  * 4 retries done → Clear timeout, hide
  * 3s timeout → Hide regardless
- Result: Always hides within 3 seconds maximum with smooth fade-out

**Benefits:**
- Guaranteed cleanup within 3 seconds
- No persistent loading indicators
- Smoother, less intrusive UX
- Proper timeout management
- Better debugging with console logs
- Ads continue to load normally
