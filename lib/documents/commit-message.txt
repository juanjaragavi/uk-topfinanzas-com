fix(kit-integration): Align payload with API requirements

This commit resolves a validation error that prevented user information from being added to KIT. The `email` field was being sent incorrectly, causing the API to reject the payload.

Changes include:
- Updated `app/api/subscribe/route.ts` to correctly handle the `email_address` field and ensure the `state` is set to "active".
- Modified `components/credit-card-form.tsx` to send `email_address` instead of `email` and include the `state: "active"` field.
- Ensured the `last_name` field is correctly nested within the `fields` object in the payload.
