feat: integrate quiz data with Google Sheets

This commit introduces Google Sheets integration for the quiz data. The quiz form now sends the filled data to a specified Google Sheet.

Changes include:
- Added a new API route `app/api/sheets/route.ts` to handle Google Sheets integration.
- Updated `components/credit-card-form.tsx` to send quiz data to the new API route.
- Removed the `gcp-auth/` directory, which is no longer needed.
