feat: Re-implement Google Ad Manager tags

- Reverted the previous ad implementation to a stable state.
- Updated the `GPTScriptManager` to define the correct ad slots and `div-gpt-ad` IDs from the PDF.
- Created a new `MobileInterstitialAd` component to handle the interstitial ad.
- Removed the `MobileOfferwallAd` component, as it was no longer needed.
- Updated the `AdDemoPage` to use the new and updated ad components.
- Restarted the TypeScript server to resolve import issues.
