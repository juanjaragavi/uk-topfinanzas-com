fix: Block AdZep interstitial overlays on blog/article pages

CRITICAL FIX: AdZep's interstitial ads were covering blog content

## Problem Identified
Console analysis revealed that AdZep was creating interstitial ad units
(uk_topfinanzas_com_mob_interstitial) that covered the entire page with
a blur overlay, blocking users from accessing blog article content.

This was NOT our custom overlay - it was AdZep's own interstitial ad format
being activated on pages where it shouldn't appear.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced CSS Blocking (app/globals.css)
Added comprehensive CSS rules to hide:
- All interstitial-related elements (by ID and class)
- Fixed-position overlays created by ad scripts
- AdZep-specific interstitial containers

### 2. Active Interstitial Blocker Component (NEW)
Created AdZepInterstitialBlocker component that:
- Monitors DOM for interstitial creation using MutationObserver
- Immediately removes interstitial overlays on blog/article pages
- Runs periodic cleanup to catch delayed injections
- Only activates on article paths (/blog/, /personal-finance/, /financial-solutions/)
- Preserves actual ad containers (uk_topfinanzas_1, uk_topfinanzas_2, etc.)

### 3. Integration (app/layout.tsx)
- Imported AdZepInterstitialBlocker
- Added to Suspense block for client-side execution
- Runs on all pages but only blocks on article paths

## Files Modified
- app/globals.css - Added interstitial blocking CSS rules
- components/analytics/adzep-interstitial-blocker.tsx - NEW active blocker
- app/layout.tsx - Integrated blocker component

## Technical Details

The blocker targets elements with:
- IDs/classes containing "interstitial"
- data-ad-type="interstitial" attributes
- Fixed/absolute positioning with z-index > 1000
- Full-screen coverage characteristics

It uses:
- MutationObserver for real-time detection
- setInterval for periodic cleanup (1s intervals)
- Conditional activation based on pathname
- Development logging for debugging

## Expected Results
âœ… Blog articles load without overlay
âœ… Content immediately accessible
âœ… Regular ad units (uk_topfinanzas_3, uk_topfinanzas_4) still display
âœ… AdZep activation continues normally
âœ… No interstitial blocking on non-article pages

## Impact
ðŸŸ¢ NO BREAKING CHANGES to ad revenue on other pages
ðŸŸ¢ Interstitials can still show on homepage, quiz, etc.
ðŸŸ¢ Only blocks interstitials on blog/article content pages

Resolves: AdZep interstitial overlay blocking blog content
