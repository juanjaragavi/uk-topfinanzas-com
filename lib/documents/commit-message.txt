fix: normalize external CTA instructions and update requirements pages

- Normalized formatting in CREDIT_CARD_PRODUCT_GENERATION.instructions.md (removed CRITICAL/bold emphasis)
- Updated 18 credit card requirements pages with external bank URLs
- Replaced internal Link components with external anchor tags (target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer")
- Added comprehensive documentation in INSTRUCTION_NORMALIZATION_SUMMARY.md
- Ensured all CTA buttons link to official bank websites, not internal benefits pages
- Fixed production bug where Requirements pages linked internally instead of to bank sites
- Maintained FCA compliance and UK market standards
