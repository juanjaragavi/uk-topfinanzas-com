âœ¨ Add brand field to Kit API integration for enhanced tracking
feat(ads): insert AdZep ad placeholders across personal-finance posts

Add standardized ad placeholder <div>s to personal-finance articles:
- uk_topfinanzas_3: immediately after the main <h1>
- uk_topfinanzas_4: immediately before the last <h2>

Also fixes a small className typo in money-management-for-beginners and
standardizes markup in best-personal-loans.
