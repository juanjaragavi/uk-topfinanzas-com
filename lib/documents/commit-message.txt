fix: Prevent empty overlays on blog listing and category pages

- Refine isArticlePath() logic to exclude listing/archive pages
- Add two-step validation: prefix match + listing page check
- Prevent overlay from showing on /blog, /personal-finance, /financial-solutions, /credit-cards
- Maintain overlay functionality on individual article pages with ad containers

This fix addresses the issue where empty overlays were appearing on blog listing pages (like /blog, /personal-finance) for 3 seconds after page load, even though these pages don't have any ad containers.

**Root Cause:**
The isArticlePath() function treated both listing pages and individual article pages the same. It returned true for both /blog (no ads) and /blog/best-personal-loans (has ads), causing the overlay to show on ALL paths matching article prefixes. Listing pages don't have ad containers (uk_topfinanzas_3, uk_topfinanzas_4), so the overlay would persist for the full 3-second timeout.

**Solution:**
Enhanced isArticlePath() with two-step validation:
1. Check if path matches article prefixes (/blog, /personal-finance, etc.)
2. Check if it's an exact match (listing page) or sub-path (article)
3. Return false for exact matches (listings), true for sub-paths (articles)

**Results:**
- /blog → isArticlePath() = false → No overlay shown
- /blog/best-personal-loans → isArticlePath() = true → Overlay shows briefly during ad init
- /personal-finance → isArticlePath() = false → No overlay shown
- /personal-finance/cashback-credit-cards → isArticlePath() = true → Overlay shows until ads load

**Benefits:**
- Listing pages load instantly without any overlay
- No wasted AdZep activation attempts on pages without ads
- Individual articles still show brief overlay during legitimate ad initialization
- Better user experience - no confusing 3-second empty overlays
- Reduced CPU usage on listing pages
- Only Offerwall and Interstitials remain as full-screen elements (no empty overlays)

**Performance Impact:**
- Before: Listing pages showed overlay for 3 seconds, wasted ad activation attempts
- After: Listing pages load instantly, zero ad-related overhead
- Article pages: Unchanged behavior (brief overlay during ad init)
