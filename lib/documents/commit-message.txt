fix: serve favicon from cdn rewrite

- proxy /favicon.png requests to media.topfinanzas.com in next.config.mjs
- update manifest and layout icons to reuse the local path
- ensure browsers resolve the icon without 404s in production
feat: prevent duplicate quiz registrations

- gate client submission with state guards and clearer status messaging
- persist registration cookies consistently and fire conversions after sheets success
- return 409 for existing sheet entries to keep analytics and storage aligned
