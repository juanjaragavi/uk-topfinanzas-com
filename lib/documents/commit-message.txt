fix: Resolve UI zoom issue on iOS devices

This commit addresses the unexpected UI zoom behavior on iOS devices when the keyboard is activated on the quiz page.

Changes include:
- Updated `app/layout.tsx`: Set `maximumScale` to `1` in the viewport meta tag to prevent unwanted scaling.
- Updated `components/steps/step3.tsx`: Changed the font size of input fields (email and first name) from `text-sm` (14px) to `text-base` (16px) to prevent iOS from automatically zooming on input focus.
