fix: Resolve UI zoom issue on iOS devices

This commit addresses the unexpected UI zoom on iOS devices (Safari and Chrome) when the keyboard activates on the 'app/quiz/page.tsx' by modifying the viewport settings in 'app/layout.tsx'.

Changes include:
- Set `maximumScale` to 1 in `app/layout.tsx` to prevent zooming.
- Explicitly set `userScalable` to `false` in `app/layout.tsx` to disable user scaling.
