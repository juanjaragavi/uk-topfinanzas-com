fix: Correct ConvertKit API authentication

This commit fixes the ConvertKit integration by correctly authenticating with the API.

Changes include:
- Updated `app/api/subscribe/route.ts` to send the API key in the `X-Kit-Api-Key` header instead of the request body.
- The API route now uses the `KIT_API_KEY` and `KIT_API_URL` environment variables for better security and configuration.
