fix: Resolve navigation refresh issue and improve AdZep tracking

- Remove conflicting AdZep trackers from credit card recommender page
- Fix AdZepLinkTracker to prevent navigation interference by:
  * Removing mousedown and touchstart events that block navigation
  * Adding setTimeout wrapper to avoid blocking link navigation
  * Using only passive click events for better performance
- Enhance AdZepNavigationHandler with better debugging and timing:
  * Increase navigation completion delay to 200ms
  * Add detailed development logging for navigation events
  * Improve error handling and availability checks
- Add text-left CSS class to all paragraph elements for consistency
- Ensure AdZep ads activate properly on all navigation types while
  preserving normal Next.js Link component behavior

This resolves the issue where internal links were refreshing pages
instead of navigating smoothly through Next.js routing.
