feat(ads): SPA-safe AdZep activation with deferred init, retries, and overlay

- Add activation utility (lib/ads/activate-adzep.ts)
  - Singleton guarded state: activated, activationInProgress, lastActivation, activationAttempts
  - Wait for AdZep function with timeout + retries
  - Helpers: pageHasAdUnits, waitForContainers (MutationObserver + timeout), hasRenderedCreative
- Add lightweight article overlay (lib/ads/overlay.ts)
  - ensureOverlay/showOverlay/hideOverlay; pointer-events: none; safe z-index
- Add SPA bridge (components/analytics/adzep-spa-bridge.tsx)
  - Waits for containers on initial load and route changes
  - Calls activateAdZep with tuned timeouts; verifies creative and retries with backoff
  - Uses overlay only on article/ad pages; hides promptly to avoid interstitial suppression
- Add central config (lib/ads/config.ts)
  - container selectors, article path prefixes, timeouts & retry counts
- Integrate bridge in layout (app/layout.tsx)
  - Wire AdZepSPABridge under Suspense alongside analytics
- Update docs (.github/instructions/ADZEP_IMPLEMENTATION.instructions.md)
  - Document new SPA bridge, utilities, configuration, and interstitial-friendly behavior
- Adjust project copilot instructions and .gitignore entries

Refs: BudgetBee pattern adaptation; ensures consistent ad rendering on initial load and SPA navigations without duplicate activations.
