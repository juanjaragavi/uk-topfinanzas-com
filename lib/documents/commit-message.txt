feat(convertkit): Map quiz responses to API payload

This commit aligns the quiz response data with the ConvertKit API payload structure, ensuring that user information is correctly mapped and sent.

Changes include:
- Modified `components/credit-card-form.tsx` to dynamically map quiz answers to the `kitData` object.
- Ensured the payload includes the mandatory `pais: "Reino Unido"` and `quiz_tarjetas: "SI"` key-value pairs.
- Removed hardcoded values from the `fields` object, allowing for flexible data mapping based on user input.
