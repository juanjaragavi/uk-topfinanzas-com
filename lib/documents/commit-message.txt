fix: Use correct environment variables for ConvertKit API

This commit fixes the ConvertKit integration by using the correct environment variables for the API key and URL.

Changes include:
- Updated `app/api/subscribe/route.ts` to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_KIT_API_KEY` and `KIT_API_URL` to ensure the environment variables are loaded correctly on the server.
