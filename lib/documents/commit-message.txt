chore: isolate topads testing from adzep

- Gate AdZep script, bridge, and dev utilities behind a temporary flag so TopAds can be validated independently.
- Refactor the TopAds SPA handler to listen to router events instead of pathname changes, preventing false triggers when the offer wall tweaks the URL.
- Simplify TopAds configuration by removing the unused autoStart flag and generating the offer wall logo URL from the current origin to avoid 404s.

Testing:
- npm run lint
