fix: Resolve AdZep ad display issue on internal navigation

- Fix AdZepNavigationHandler to properly handle Next.js internal navigation
- Add usePathname hook to detect route changes and trigger ad activation
- Ensure window.AdZepActivateAds() is called on all navigation types:
  * Initial page load
  * Internal navigation (Next.js Link components)
  * Browser back/forward navigation
  * Direct URL access
- Add detailed development logging for debugging navigation events
- Update documentation to reflect improved navigation handling

This resolves the issue where AdZep ads only displayed after manual
page reload and not during internal site navigation.
