feat: Add ConvertKit subscriber action to quiz forms

This commit introduces a new action to the quiz configuration that adds a user as a subscriber to a ConvertKit list upon quiz completion.

Changes include:
- Created a new API route at `app/api/subscribe/route.ts` to handle the ConvertKit subscription logic securely on the server-side.
- Modified the `handleSubmit` function in `components/credit-card-form.tsx` to send the user's data to the new `/api/subscribe` endpoint.
- Removed the old `lib/utils/kit-integration.js` file as it is no longer needed.
- Added `.env.production.local` to manage production-specific environment variables.
