feat(convertkit): Fully map quiz responses to API payload

This commit ensures all quiz response data is correctly mapped to the ConvertKit API payload structure, resolving the issue of missing fields.

Changes include:
- Updated `components/credit-card-form.tsx` to dynamically map all quiz answers to the `kitData` object, ensuring all fields in the `payload-create-user-kit.json` schema are populated.
- Removed hardcoded null values and replaced them with dynamic data from the form state.
