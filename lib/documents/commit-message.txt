fix: Repair corrupted YAML frontmatter in privacy policy

- Fix corrupted YAML frontmatter in content/legal/privacy-policy.mdx
- Restore proper structure with clean title, effectiveDate, and lastUpdated fields
- Remove corrupted content that was mixed into the frontmatter
- Resolve build error: "YAMLParseError: Implicit keys need to be on a single line"
