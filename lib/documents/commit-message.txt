CRITICAL FIX: Remove CSS rules blocking AdZep ad interactions

ROOT CAUSE - The Real Issue:
While we previously disabled the AdZepInterstitialBlocker JavaScript component,
the CRITICAL production bug persisted because aggressive CSS rules in app/globals.css
were STILL blocking all ad interactions with !important declarations.

CSS Rules That Were Blocking Ads:
1. [id*="interstitial"], [class*="interstitial"] 
   - Matched LEGITIMATE AdZep interstitial ad units
   - Applied: display:none !important, pointer-events:none !important

2. [id*="rewardful"], [class*="rewardful"], [id*="reward"]
   - Matched LEGITIMATE AdZep offerwall/rewardful ad units  
   - Applied: display:none !important, pointer-events:none !important, z-index:-9999 !important

3. [id*="overlay"], [class*="adzep-overlay"], [id*="ad-overlay"]
   - Blocked overlay elements and ad containers
   - Applied: display:none !important, pointer-events:none !important

Why JavaScript Fix Wasn't Enough:
- CSS !important rules OVERRIDE all JavaScript changes
- Even with JS component disabled, CSS kept blocking everything
- pointer-events:none !important made ALL ad elements completely unclickable
- Broad pattern matching ([id*="interstitial"]) matched legitimate ad units

Production Impact - User Journey Failure:
1. User lands on /quiz via AdWords campaign with UTM parameters
2. User fills form (Name: Juan, Email: juanamillo@gmail.com)  
3. User submits form
4. AdZep interstitial ad loads (as intended)
5. ‚ùå CSS applies pointer-events:none !important
6. ‚ùå User clicks close button ‚Üí NOTHING HAPPENS
7. ‚ùå User clicks anywhere ‚Üí NOTHING HAPPENS  
8. ‚ùå User is STUCK, cannot proceed
9. ‚ùå 100% revenue loss, conversion blocked, user frustrated

Solution Implemented:
‚úÖ COMPLETELY REMOVED all ad-blocking CSS rules from app/globals.css (~70 lines removed)
‚úÖ Removed: [id*="interstitial"] patterns
‚úÖ Removed: [class*="rewardful"] patterns  
‚úÖ Removed: [id*="overlay"] patterns
‚úÖ Removed: All display:none !important rules for ads
‚úÖ Removed: All pointer-events:none !important rules for ads
‚úÖ Removed: All z-index:-9999 rules
‚úÖ Kept: Body scroll unlock rules (these ENABLE interaction, not block it)

What This Fixes:
‚úÖ Interstitial ads now fully clickable and dismissible
‚úÖ Close buttons on ads are responsive
‚úÖ Offerwall/rewardful ads fully interactive
‚úÖ Users can complete quiz journey after form submission
‚úÖ Revenue generation restored across all pages
‚úÖ Conversion funnel unblocked
‚úÖ AdWords campaigns effective again

Why This Took Two Fixes:
Fix #1 (Previous): Disabled JavaScript component - ‚úÖ Done
Fix #2 (This Fix): Removed CSS !important rules - ‚úÖ Done

Key Lesson: CSS !important rules are MORE POWERFUL than JavaScript.
Always check BOTH layers (JS and CSS) when debugging interaction issues.
