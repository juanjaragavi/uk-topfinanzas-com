- Set quality to 85 for optimal balance

### Impact
- Expected 50-60% reduction in LCP time (4.5s → 2.0s)
- Automatic AVIF/WebP format negotiation
- Proper responsive image sizing with srcset
- Better caching through Next.js optimization pipeline

## Priority 2: Remove Excessive Priority Flags

### Changes

### Impact

- Expected 45% improvement in TTI (5.5s → 3.0s)
- 70-80% reduction in initial image requests (25 → 5)
