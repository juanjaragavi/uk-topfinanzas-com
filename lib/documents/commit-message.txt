feat: Update Quiz CTA to redirect to external link with UTM preservation

## Changes
- Created new URL builder utility (`/lib/utils/url-builder.ts`) for handling external redirects with UTM parameters
- Updated both quiz form components to redirect to https://linkly.link/2ERav instead of internal `/credit-card-recommender-p1` route
- UTM parameters (source, medium, campaign, term, content) are now automatically preserved and appended to the external redirect URL

## Technical Details
- New `buildUrlWithUtmParams()` function reads UTM params from sessionStorage and appends to any URL
- New `redirectWithUtmParams()` function handles external redirects with UTM preservation
- Uses `window.location.href` for proper external navigation instead of Next.js router
- Backward compatible: works with or without UTM parameters

## Files Modified
- `/components/credit-card-form.tsx` - Updated 2 redirect locations
- `/components/credit-card-form-to-product.tsx` - Updated 2 redirect locations  
- `/lib/utils/url-builder.ts` - New utility file created

## Testing Required
- Verify external redirect works from both /quiz and /quiz-2 pages
- Confirm UTM parameters are preserved in destination URL
- Check that analytics/conversion events still fire correctly
- Test with and without UTM parameters present

- External link router managed by Linkly: https://linkly.link/2ERav
- Maintains all existing analytics, conversion tracking, and cookie persistence
- No impact on Google Sheets or Kit.com integration
