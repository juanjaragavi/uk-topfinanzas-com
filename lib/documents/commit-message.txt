fix: Remove overlay blur blocking article content

BREAKING CHANGES: None - AdZep functionality fully preserved

## Problem Fixed
- Overlay blur was blocking all content on blog/article pages
- Users could not access Personal Finance and Financial Solutions articles
- Required manual page refresh to clear overlay

## Solution Implemented
1. Neutralized overlay functions in lib/ads/overlay.ts
   - All functions converted to no-ops (do nothing)
   - Functions still exist to prevent breaking imports
   - Zero visual rendering or DOM manipulation

2. Cleaned up AdZep SPA bridge
   - Removed overlay imports from adzep-spa-bridge.tsx
   - Removed hideOverlay() calls on lines 51 and 67
   - Added documentation comments explaining changes

3. Preserved AdZep advertising functionality
   - window.AdZepActivateAds() still executes normally
   - Container detection logic unchanged
   - Retry and verification mechanisms intact
   - Excluded paths (quiz pages) still work correctly

## Files Modified
- components/analytics/adzep-spa-bridge.tsx
- lib/ads/overlay.ts
- lib/documents/OVERLAY_BLUR_FIX.md (comprehensive documentation)

## Testing
âœ… Build completed successfully with no errors

## Expected Results
