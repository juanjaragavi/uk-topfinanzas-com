fix: Prevent ad overlay on Quiz pages blocking form submission

## Critical Bug Fix
Users reported an overlay appearing after completing the Quiz form (entering name), which prevented clicking the CTA button and completing submission. Investigation revealed AdZep activation was attempting to render ads on Quiz pages despite ads being explicitly disabled.

## Root Cause
The AdZep SPA Bridge was activating ads on ALL pages, including `/quiz` and `/quiz-2`. While `<AdController disableAds={true} />` hides ad containers with CSS, it doesn't prevent the AdZep activation process, which shows an overlay while waiting for ad units to load.

## Solution
Implemented path exclusion system to completely skip ad activation on specific pages:

### Changes to `/lib/ads/config.ts`
- Added `excludedPaths` property to `AdZepConfig` interface
- Added `/quiz` and `/quiz-2` to exclusion list
- Created `isExcludedPath()` helper function to check if current path should never show ads

### Changes to `/components/analytics/adzep-spa-bridge.tsx`
- Import `isExcludedPath` from config
- Added early exit in `handleRouteComplete()` for excluded paths
- Added exclusion check in `handleRouteStart()` to prevent overlay
- Explicitly hide overlay when on excluded paths

## Technical Impact
- Quiz pages: NO ad activation, NO overlay, NO ad units
- Other pages: Ad activation continues normally (blog, financial solutions, etc.)
- Performance: Reduced unnecessary activation attempts on quiz pages
- UX: Quiz forms now fully functional without ad interference

## Testing Completed
- ✅ Quiz form completion works without overlay
- ✅ CTA button remains clickable throughout form
- ✅ Form submission and redirect to external link works
- ✅ Ads still activate correctly on blog/article pages

## Files Modified
- `/lib/ads/config.ts` - Added excluded paths configuration
- `/components/analytics/adzep-spa-bridge.tsx` - Added exclusion logic
- `/QUIZ_AD_OVERLAY_FIX.md` - Comprehensive documentation
