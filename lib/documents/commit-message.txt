feat(blog): refactor blog structure and enhance homepage

- Refactored blog post handling to use dynamic routes (`/blog/post/[slug]`) and fetch content/metadata from MDX files in `/content/blog/`.
- Created API route `/api/posts` to serve blog data.
- Enhanced homepage (`/app/page.tsx`) with dynamic post loading, category filtering, and pagination.
- Fixed various build errors related to MDX processing and missing frontmatter.
- Resolved runtime errors ("Rendered more hooks") on the homepage.
- Addressed broken image issues by updating frontmatter and Next.js image configuration.
- Styled pagination buttons on the homepage.
