Fix empty overlay issue with AdZep interstitial ads - implement multi-layer backdrop cleaner

- Create AdZepBackdropCleaner component for active monitoring and removal of orphaned backdrop elements
- Component detects empty backdrop/overlay elements when interstitial ads fail to render
- Implements smart detection: checks for fixed position, z-index >1000, blur effects, backdrop class/ID names
- Content verification: identifies iframes, AdZep containers, meaningful element sizes to preserve legitimate ads
- Automatic cleanup: removes orphaned backdrops, restores body overflow/position, clears aria-hidden attributes
- Continuous monitoring via MutationObserver and 2-second interval cleanup with 500ms delay for ad loading
- Add enhanced CSS rules in globals.css: hide backdrop elements without ad content using :has() selector
- CSS targets fixed-position elements with z-index excluding iframes, images, and AdZep ad units
- Additional CSS protection removes blur effects from backdrops without actual ad content
- Integrate AdZepBackdropCleaner into app/layout.tsx alongside other analytics components
- Verify window.AdZepActivateAds() is being called correctly via SPA bridge and activation utility
- Create comprehensive documentation: EMPTY_OVERLAY_FIX.md (technical), EMPTY_OVERLAY_FIX_SUMMARY.md (quick reference)
- Add EMPTY_OVERLAY_IMPLEMENTATION.md with complete implementation guide and troubleshooting
- Create test-overlay-fix.html visual test page for interactive testing of backdrop detection and cleanup
- Fix resolves issue where ads fail to render (isDisplay: false) but backdrop remains, blocking user access
- Solution preserves legitimate interstitial ads while removing empty overlays automatically
- Root cause: AdZep creates backdrop elements for interstitials that remain when ads fail due to network/rules/inventory
- Multi-layer defense: CSS passive layer + JavaScript active monitoring + proper AdZep activation verification
- Development logging provides clear console feedback for debugging backdrop removal operations
- No negative impact on ad revenue - only removes orphaned elements without blocking actual ad units
