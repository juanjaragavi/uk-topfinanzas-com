fix: Disable overlay blur on blog/article pages while preserving AdZep activation

## Problem
- Unsolicited overlay blur appeared on blog posts and Financial Solutions pages
- Overlay blocked user interaction and made content inaccessible
- Required manual refresh to clear

## Solution
- Disabled overlay system in AdZepSPABridge component
- Removed showOverlay() calls at all trigger points
- Preserved AdZep ad activation logic (window.AdZepActivateAds)
- Maintained ad unit rendering functionality

## Changes
- components/analytics/adzep-spa-bridge.tsx:
  - Disabled overlay on route start (line 54-58)
  - Disabled overlay on article paths (line 75-85)
  - Removed overlay cleanup logic from verification callbacks
  - Removed overlay grace period

## Impact
- ✅ No visual overlay on blog/article pages
- ✅ Content immediately accessible
- ✅ AdZep ads continue to load normally
- ✅ No changes to ad rendering behavior

## Testing
Verified on: /financial-solutions/barclaycard-avios-plus-requirements
- No overlay appears
- AdZep activation executes correctly
- Ad units render without issues
