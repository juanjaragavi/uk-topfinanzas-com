Optimize: Restructure financial product generation system prompt for LLM workflows

ISSUE:
The CREDIT_CARD_PRODUCT_GENERATION.instructions.md system prompt needed optimization 
for better processing by LLM-based virtual assistants. The previous structure lacked 
clear workflow guidance, had scattered information, and didn't provide quick reference 
for agents to orient themselves.

FILES MODIFIED:
1. lib/CREDIT_CARD_PRODUCT_GENERATION.instructions.md - Complete restructuring

CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:

1. ENHANCED STRUCTURE:
   - Added clear Role Definition and Primary Objective sections
   - Created Quick Reference section for rapid agent orientation
   - Reorganized all sections with better hierarchy and clarity

2. OPTIMIZED RESOURCES SECTION:
   - Separated into Primary/Secondary data sources
   - Added explicit access methods (fetch_webpage, fetch_txt)
   - Clarified data priority hierarchy

3. EXPANDED CAPABILITIES SECTION:
   - Organized into 7 logical categories:
     * Data Acquisition & Processing
     * Code Generation
     * Content Creation
     * UK Financial Compliance
     * UK Market Localization
     * Technical Implementation
     * Quality Assurance

4. IMPROVED LIMITATIONS SECTION:
   - Structured into clear constraint categories
   - Added "When to Halt Generation" checklist
   - Clarified error conditions and boundaries

5. COMPREHENSIVE WORKFLOW SECTION:
   - Transformed into structured 7-step workflow
   - Added Step 1-7 with clear subsections
   - Enhanced error handling protocols
   - Emphasized critical output requirements

6. NEW SUMMARY SECTION:
   - Pre-Generation Checklist
   - Execution Sequence (7 steps)
   - Success Criteria (10 checkpoints)
   - Failure Points (5 halt conditions)
   - Action on failure guidance

VARIABLE OPTIMIZATION:
- Converted example fields to {camelCase} variables:
  * {blogPostCategory}, {productCategory}, {productName}
  * {officialProductUrl}, {brandColorHex}, {heroImageUrl}
  * {mainKeywords}, {pageTitle}, {contentFocus}
  * {seoIntentType}, {customerJourneyStage}, etc.

IMPACT:
âœ… Better LLM agent comprehension and execution
âœ… Clear sequential workflow from input to output
âœ… Multiple verification checkpoints throughout process
âœ… Explicit error handling and halt conditions
âœ… Quick orientation for new agents
âœ… Actionable, structured guidance
âœ… Maintains all FCA compliance requirements
âœ… Preserves all technical specifications

STRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
âœ… Logical section flow and organization
âœ… Consistent formatting and hierarchy
âœ… Action-oriented language throughout
âœ… Clear tool specifications (fetch_webpage, fetch_txt)
âœ… Comprehensive success/failure criteria
âœ… Production-ready for virtual assistant workflows

Priority: ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM - Accessibility compliance and console cleanliness
Status: âœ… READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
