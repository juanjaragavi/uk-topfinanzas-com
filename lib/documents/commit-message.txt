fix(convertkit): Correctly handle nested fields in API route

This commit resolves the issue where nested fields were not being correctly processed by the API route.

Changes include:
- Updated `app/api/subscribe/route.ts` to correctly destructure the `fields` object from the request body.
- Ensured that the `api_key` is included in the payload sent to the ConvertKit API.
