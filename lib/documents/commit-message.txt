Enhanced Google Sheets API logging for UTM parameter troubleshooting

Added comprehensive logging to /app/api/sheets/route.ts to diagnose production failures when UTM parameters are present:
- Request body analysis (field presence, sizes, UTM values)
- Environment variable validation
- Authentication success confirmation
- Enhanced error context (error details, UTM presence, payload size)

This will capture the exact failure mode in production when forms are submitted with UTM parameters, which currently return 500 errors while submissions without UTM parameters succeed.
