# 🚨 Production Issue - Quick Summary

## Problem

The quiz form on **uk.topfinanzas.com** is failing to save user data with a **500 Internal Server Error**.

## Root Cause

**Missing environment variables in production.** The Google Sheets API credentials are configured locally but NOT on your production server.

## Evidence

1. ✅ Local testing works perfectly (we created test contact successfully)
2. ❌ Production shows: `POST https://uk.topfinanzas.com/api/sheets 500 (Internal Server Error)`
3. ❌ Console error: `[QUIZ] Error handling submission Error: Failed to add data to sheet`
4. ✅ Brevo IS working in production (you have 1 contact in List #9 - "Test User")

## Solution

Add these environment variables to your production server:

```bash
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=sheets-service-account@absolute-brook-452020-d5.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="[full private key - see PRODUCTION_SETUP.md]"
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=11Su3cEkJbVPcCqix2oc1Md-3XbKagySuobf9FfakdIs
BREVO_API_KEY=xkeysib-[REDACTED_FOR_SECURITY]
```

## How to Fix

### Quick Steps

1. **Access your production server/hosting platform**
2. **Add the environment variables** (see PRODUCTION_SETUP.md for exact values)
3. **Restart/rebuild your application**
4. **Test the quiz form** at uk.topfinanzas.com/quiz

### Detailed Instructions

See `PRODUCTION_SETUP.md` for complete step-by-step instructions.

## Verification

After adding environment variables, test:

- Submit quiz form
- Check browser console (should show success, no errors)
- Verify data appears in Google Sheets
- Check Brevo dashboard for new contact with "United Kingdom" in COUNTRIES

## Why Local Works But Production Doesn't

| Environment    | Status     | Reason                                |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Local**      | ✅ Working | Environment variables in `.env.local` |
| **Production** | ❌ Failing | Environment variables NOT configured  |

## What's Working vs Not Working

### ✅ Working

- Brevo API integration (contact created successfully)
- Form validation and UI
- Local development environment
- Dynamic ext_id generation
- Static COUNTRIES field

### ❌ Not Working

- Google Sheets API in production (missing credentials)
- Form data persistence in production
- User data collection

## Impact

- 🚫 **No user data is being saved** to Google Sheets in production
- ⚠️ Users see error message: "We couldn't confirm your registration. Please try again in a moment."
- ✅ Brevo contacts ARE being created (partial success)

## Priority

🚨 **URGENT** - This is blocking user registrations and data collection.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Add environment variables to production
2. **Verify**: Test form submission after deployment
3. **Monitor**: Check for any other errors
4. **Optional**: Set up monitoring/alerting for API failures
